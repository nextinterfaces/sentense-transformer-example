# Sentence Transformers Basic Example ðŸš€

A simple example to get started with sentence transformers in Jupyter Lab.

## Quick Setup

Follow these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# 1. Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# 2. Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Install Jupyter kernel for this environment
python -m ipykernel install --user --name sentence-transformers --display-name "Python (sentence-transformers)"

# 5. Start Jupyter Lab
jupyter lab
```

**Important:** After opening the notebook in Jupyter Lab:
- Make sure to select **"Python (sentence-transformers)"** as your kernel
- Look at the top-right corner and click on the kernel selector if needed
- Then run the cells!

## Next Steps

Once you've run through the basic example, you can:
- Experiment with different sentences
- Try other models like `all-mpnet-base-v2`
- Build your own semantic search system

Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
